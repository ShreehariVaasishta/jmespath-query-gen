# JMESPath Query Generator
The JMESPath Query Generator is a web app that allows you to generate JMESPath queries for JSON data. JMESPath is a query language for JSON data that allows you to extract and transform data in a flexible and powerful way. This app provides an easy-to-use interface for building and testing JMESPath queries.

## Getting Started
To use the JMESPath Query Generator, simply enter your JSON data into the input field, and the app will generate a list of available keys. You can then select a key to generate a JMESPath query that extracts the value associated with that key. The result of the query is displayed in the output field.

## Usage
Input Field
The input field is used to enter JSON data. You can paste JSON directly into the field, or use the JSON editor to create or modify JSON data. When you enter or modify JSON data, the app will automatically generate a list of available keys.

## Query Selector Field
The query selector field displays a list of available keys. You can select a key to generate a JMESPath query that extracts the value associated with that key.

## Output Field
The output field displays the result of the JMESPath query. When you select a key in the query selector field, the app generates a JMESPath query and displays the result of the query in the output field.

## Built With
